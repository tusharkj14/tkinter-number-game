# Number Game App!

Made a python GUI application using **TKinter**. 


# Description

The app asks the User to submit his/her name first.
The second row contains three levels:

 - Beginner - If you select this, then two numbers between 1 and 9 are randomly generated
 - Intermediate - If you select this, then two numbers between 10 and 99 are randomly generated
 - Advance - If you select this, then two numbers between 100 and 500 are randomly generated
 
 The third row contains four kind of operations:
 
 - "+" - this indicates the addition operation
 -"-" - this indicates the subtraction operation
 - "*" - this indicates the multiplication operation
 - "/" - this indicates the integer division operation

Then the user is asked to input the answer of a mathematical calculation based on the Operation and level selected.
The last Label is used to display whether the user has given the correct output or not.

**Every time an operation is selected or every time a level is selected, the numbers are generated randomly**
